## Week 14 Lab

##### Produced CRUD pages for my data model using Scaffolding. This included having to add keys to my model classes, adding a connection string, and create new models for the process.

#### I then created the database using Scaffolding. No errors were experienced, so I migrated and updated the created DB.
