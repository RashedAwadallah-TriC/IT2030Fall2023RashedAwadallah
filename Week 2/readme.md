### Week 2 Lab

##### Summary
###### Added the summary description of my project to the home page, an out-of-place image, and added/linked a custom.css file.
### 
###### It was easy and it gave me time to familiarize with ASP NET CORE MVC (what a long name). Next week and beyond, I hope to take my project up to the next level.
